## Where is my task?
If your task is not in your tasks page on the Magniv Dashboard verify the following:

1. Your last build in the builds table has successfully ran (if not [see below](#build-fail))
2. Your the file your task is located in is in the tasks folder
3. Your task is decorated with the magniv `@task` ([see here](../documentation/task-decorator))
4. Your task has no import errors in the workspace ([see here](./))


## Why is my task not running on schedule?
Verify that the crontab that you used is correct. Use [this website](https://crontab.guru/) to verify

## Why is my task failing?
The best way to debug this is to check the logs for the run and see what is going on, usually it is a python error. 

Common ones include forgetting to update the requirements.txt file or an incorrect version of python when setting up a workspace.

If your build run logs are empty, make sure you have magniv in your requirements.txt

## Why did my build fail? {#build-fail}

Check the error in the builds history page, that will usually give you information on why the build failed.

Most common reasons are incorrect [file structure](../documentation/file-structure), forgetting a requirements.txt file or using a [key](https://docs.magniv.io/documentation/task-decorator#fields) more than once.

## How do I create a requirements.txt? 

In order for Magniv to work you need to have a requirements.txt and have the neccissary libraries and versions in your requirements.txt.
If you forget a requirements.txt your build will fail, if you have the improper librariers in it your task will fail. 

It is highly reccomended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). To create a requirements.txt when using a venv run the following command in your tasks folder:
```bash 
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you are using conda to manage your virtual environment you need to run a slighly different command to create a requirements.txt: 
```bash
    pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
```
