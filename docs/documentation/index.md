# Documentation

All Magniv projects need to conform to a specific [file structure](../documentation/file-structure).

The Magniv Core Python library is comprised of two main parts:

* [The task decorator class](../documentation/task-decorator)
* [The CLI](../documentation/cli)


All users of `magniv` will interact with the task decorator class. The CLI, however, is only relevant for self-hosted installations as well as local debugging.
