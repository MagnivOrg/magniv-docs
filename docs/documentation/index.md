# Documentation

All magniv projects need to follow a [file structure](../documentation/file-structure).

There are two parts to the magniv python library

* [The task decorator class](../documentation/task-decorator)
* [The CLI](../documentation/cli)


Everyone who uses magniv needs to use the task decorator class.

The CLI is relevant for self-hosting and for debbuging purposes.
