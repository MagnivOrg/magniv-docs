# Getting Started

Let's get rocking with Magniv ðŸš€!

## Installation
Magniv core can be found on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/magniv/) and installed with pip
```bash
    pip install magniv
```

## Running Magniv
Magniv can be hosted or self-hosted.

Self-hosted works well for teams that need tight control of infrastructure and security.
Hosted is perfecct for teams that want to move quickly and not worry about how things work in the backend.
